<h2>Tech Games Functional Programming Challenge</h2>

<p>
    This challenge has 10 problems. The learn-ocaml system will mark your solutions out of 100pts but we will be grandting a 1.25 scale curve (i.e. we will 80% completion as full marks). No bonus points for achieving above 80% will be awarded unforntunately.
</p>
<strong>Important Note 1: The number of points assigned to a problem is no indication of the it's difficulty.</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Important Node 2: Download your code after every question so you have a locally saved version of your progress.
  <br>The system's sync feature is not controlled by us so if you loose your code there is nothing we can do :(.</strong>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Identity (5 points)
        </h4>
        Implement the identity function with the following type:
        <pre>val identity : 'a -> 'a = &lt;fun&gt; </pre>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>
            Reverse (10 points)
        </h4>
        Implement the function reverse that takes in a list and reverses the order of the elements in the list.The function should have the following type signature:
        <pre>val reverse : 'a list -> 'a list = &lt;fun&gt; </pre>
    </li>


    <li>
        <h4>
            Palindrome (10 points)
        </h4>
        Implement the function reverse that takes in a list and checks if it's a palindrome. The function should have the following type signature:
        <pre>val palindrome : 'a list -> bool = &lt;fun&gt; </pre>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>
            Squeeze (15 pts)
        </h4>
        Implement the recursive function squeeze that eliminates the consecutive duplicates of elements in a list. Remember! We only want to eliminate consecutive duplicates. The function has the following typ signature:
        <pre>val squeeze : 'a list -> 'a list =  &lt;fun&gt; </pre> Here is an example execution:
        <pre>
            #  squeeze [1;2;2;2;3;3;2;4;4];;
            - : int list = [1; 2; 3; 2; 4]
        </pre>
    </li>


    <li>
        <h4>
            Sprinkle (20 points)
        </h4>
        Implement the recursive function sprinkle that takes in a list and returns a list of pairs of list. Imagine that you have an input list. You are going to construct a pair of lists by going down the input list and choosing arbitrarily whether to put it
        in the first or the second output list. You may put all of them in one list and none in the other or you may put some of them in each list. You should never scramble the order of the elements. The spray is constructed by showing all possible choices.
        The function has the following type signature:
        <pre>val sprinkle : 'a list -> ('a list * 'a list) list = &lt;fun&gt; </pre> Here are some examples:
        <pre>
            # sprinkle [1;2;3;4];;
            - : (int list * int list) list =
            [([1; 2; 3; 4], []); ([1; 2; 3], [4]); ([1; 2; 4], [3]); ([1; 2], [3; 4]);
            ([1; 3; 4], [2]); ([1; 3], [2; 4]); ([1; 4], [2; 3]); ([1], [2; 3; 4]);
            ([2; 3; 4], [1]); ([2; 3], [1; 4]); ([2; 4], [1; 3]); ([2], [1; 3; 4]);
            ([3; 4], [1; 2]); ([3], [1; 2; 4]); ([4], [1; 2; 3]); ([], [1; 2; 3; 4])]
            # sprinkle [1;3;2];;
            - : (int list * int list) list =
            [([1; 3; 2], []); ([1; 3], [2]); ([1; 2], [3]); ([1], [3; 2]); ([3; 2], [1]);
            ([3], [1; 2]); ([2], [1; 3]); ([], [1; 3; 2])]
            # sprinkle [’a’;’x’;’g’];;
            - : (char list * char list) list =
            [([’a’; ’x’; ’g’], []); ([’a’; ’x’], [’g’]); ([’a’; ’g’], [’x’]);
            ([’a’], [’x’; ’g’]); ([’x’; ’g’], [’a’]); ([’x’], [’a’; ’g’]);
            ([’g’], [’a’; ’x’]); ([], [’a’; ’x’; ’g’])]
        </pre>
    </li>


    <li>
        <h4>
            Enumarate the K-Combinations of a List (10 points)
        </h4>
        Given an n element list l, and an integer k, generate all the combinations of k distinct objects chosen from the N elements in l.
        <p>
            <strong>Hint</strong>: Consider the recursive definiction of the <code>C(n,k)</code>.
        </p>
        This function should have the following type signature:
        <pre>'a list * int -> 'a list list = &lt;fun&gt; </pre>
    </li>

    <h3>
        <br> Lets talk about Trees:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Consider a tree defined by the following:
        <pre>type 'a tree = Node of 'a * 'a tree list</pre> This type declaration allows us to represent trees of any arity. Furthermore this definition enforces the requirements that all trees must have at least one Node (i.e. we cannot have "Empty"
        valued leaves/trees). We will use this definition in the next 3 problems.
    </p>

    <li>
        <h4>
            Count the number of Nodes in a Tree (15 points)
        </h4>
        Given a tree t with arbitrary arity throughout each node, implement the function countNodes that counts the number of nodes in a t.
        <p>
            <strong>Hint</strong>: This can be implemented in 3 lines using a higher-order function (since a node's children are stored in a list). How can we aggregate counts in this situation?
        </p>
        This function should have the following type signature:
        <pre>val countNodes : 'a tree -> int = &lt;fun&gt; </pre>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>IronOut (20 pts) </h4>
        Implement the fuction ironOut that takes a int tree and returns a list of int lists. Your function should enumerate all possible paths from the root to a leaf node. Caution, the tree type e defined are multi-way trees, which means they can have more than
        2 children. The function has the following type signature:
        <pre>val iron_out : int tree -> int list list = &lt;fun&gt;</pre> Here are some examples:
        <pre>#let  exampleTree : int tree =
            Node (1,
             [Node (2, []);
              Node (3,
               [Node (4, []); Node (5, []);
                Node (6, [Node (7, []); Node (8, []); Node (9, []); Node (10, [])])])])
            
          # ironOut exampleTree;;
          - : int list list =
          [[1; 2]; [1; 3; 4]; [1; 3; 5]; [1; 3; 6; 7]; [1; 3; 6; 8]; [1; 3; 6; 9];
           [1; 3; 6; 10]]</pre>
        <pre>
            #let exampleTree2 = Node (1, [ Node (2, []) 
                                        ; Node (3, [])
                                        ; Node (4, [ Node (5, [])
                                                   ; Node (6, []) ])
                                        ]);;
            #ironOut exampleTree2;;
            - : int list list = [[1; 2]; [1; 3]; [1; 4; 5]; [1; 4; 6]]</pre>
    </li>

    <h3>
        <br> Fold vs Unfold:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Fold (also known as reduce) is a popular higher-order functonal method used to aggregate/sumarize information from a bag of elements. This is usually conducted by presenting an aggregation function and state value that are used in conjunction to accumulate
        information when travering the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now introduce the concept of unfold, which acts as the reverse (or to be mathematically accurate "the categorical dual") of fold. Here we use an expansion function and state value to generate a bag of elements. For the sake of simplcity, we will only
        consider the unfold function for lists. We present an implementaton of unfold (in the prelude and below) for lists which takes as input an expansion/generator function, a stop predicate, and a state, and outputs a list generated from the specification
        of the input. Below is the implementation available in the prelude:
        <pre>
let rec unfold (f: 'seed -> ('a * 'seed)) (stop : 'b -> bool) (b : 'seed) : 'a list =
  if stop b then []
  else
    begin
      let x, b' = f b in
      x :: (unfold f stop b')
    end
;;
val unfold : ('b -> 'a * 'b) -> ('b -> bool) -> 'b -> 'a list = &lt;fun&gt;
</pre> We see that the generator function takes as input an initial state and generates a new element and a new state. Furthermore, the stop predicate is used to determine when to stop generating elements (since bags are of finite size), conditioned
        on the state.
    </p>
    <p>
        We present 2 examples of the use of unfold, available in the prelude, and will use this function to implement the final 2 questions.
    </p>

    <li>
        <h4>
            Fibonacci Sequence (10 points)
        </h4>
        Implement the function fib that takes an input an integer n and generate a list composed of the fibonacci sequcne up to (and including) n.
        <br><br> Below is an example of the expected command line execution of fib:
        <pre>
# fib 0;;
- : int list = []
# fib 1;;
- : int list = [1; 1]
# fib 2;;
- : int list = [1; 1; 2]
# fib 3;;
- : int list = [1; 1; 2; 3]
# fib 20;;
- : int list = [1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13]
# fib 21;;
- : int list = [1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21]
</pre>
        <strong>Hint</strong>: Consider an initial state/seed <code>(fib 0, fib 1) = (1,1)</code>.
        <br><br> This function should have the following type signature:
        <pre>val fib : int -> int list = &lt;fun&gt; </pre>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>
            Pascal's Triangle (5 points)
        </h4>
        Implement the function pascal that takes an input an integer n and generate a list composed of the rows of pascal's triangle up to (and excluding) n. <strong>Note</strong>: Here we want to generate a list of lists, where the index <code>i</code>        the outer most list corresponds to row <code>(i+1)</code> in pascal's triangle.
        <br><br> Below is an example of the expected command line execution of fib:
        <pre>
# pascal 0;;
- : int list list = []
# pascal 1;;
- : int list list = []
# pascal 2;;
- : int list list = [[1]]
# pascal 3;;
- : int list list = [[1]; [1; 1]]
# pascal 10;;
- : int list list =
[[1]; [1; 1]; [1; 2; 1]; [1; 3; 3; 1]; [1; 4; 6; 4; 1]; [1; 5; 10; 10; 5; 1];
 [1; 6; 15; 20; 15; 6; 1]; [1; 7; 21; 35; 35; 21; 7; 1];
 [1; 8; 28; 56; 70; 56; 28; 8; 1]]
</pre>
        <strong>Hint</strong>: Consider the higher order function List.map2.
        <br><br> This function should have the following type signature:
        <pre>val pascal : int -> int list list = &lt;fun&gt; </pre>
    </li>
